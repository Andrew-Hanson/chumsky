# Welcome to chumsky

Welcome to the guide for chumsky, a parser combinator library for Rust that lets you write high-performance, expressive
parsers with ease.

Here you will find useful resources for learning about both chumsky and parsing more broadly, along with many examples.
There is also a tutorial that will guide you through the implementation of a simple programming language (complete with
a simple interpreter) using chumsky for both lexing and parsing.

This guide is split up into several sections.
